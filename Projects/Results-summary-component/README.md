## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This one was especially great beacuse it turned my head around and made me open my eyes to what exactly we need to do to make all the necessary resorces of a page being visible and readable to the user.

With this project, I also have learned about:
- CSS Stylesheets segmentation
- CSS Local font load/use
- More about how to use @media

I segmented the stylesheets by definitions and usability. I separated them into three files:
- `main_def_style.css`: Defines the css variables and main resources to use into the page
- `style.css`: Defines all the reference elementsto be used
- `def_dynamicastyle.css`: Defines the @media applications to make the page responsive
