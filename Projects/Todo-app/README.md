## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS Superset
- [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) - JS Library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass

### What I learned

With this challenging project I was able to understand better how react works and I was able to get what is the main propose of using Typescript with it, which makes the development clearer and semantic coeherent to anyone.

### Continued development

For now I will continuosly focus on react improvement and learn more react extensions as "react-beautiful-dnd" to help solve some especific problems on development
